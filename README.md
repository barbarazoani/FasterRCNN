# PyTorch Object Detection using Faster R-CNN
This repository demonstrates the implementation of object detection in images using the Faster R-CNN algorithm within the PyTorch framework. Faster R-CNN is a highly effective object detection method that combines the strengths of both Fast R-CNN and a region proposal network (RPN) for generating high-quality region proposals, which are then used by Fast R-CNN for detection.

### Introduction
Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision that involves identifying and locating objects of certain classes in the image. PyTorch, known for its flexibility and ease of use in building deep learning models, is used here to implement Faster R-CNN, which is renowned for its efficiency and accuracy in detecting objects.

### What is Faster R-CNN?
Faster R-CNN, an advancement of Fast R-CNN, incorporates a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. These region proposals are then used by Fast R-CNN for the detection task. This integration enhances the speed and accuracy of the object detection pipeline.
